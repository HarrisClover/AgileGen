When designing a web page that should be beautiful, adhere to material design principles and meet the accessibility color requirements, here are some points you should consider:
Material Design Principles:
Use bold and graphic colors deliberately to highlight the most important information on your page.
Use shadows and depth effects sparingly to signify different user interface (UI) levels.
Use responsive animations and transitions to give user feedback or to create a sense of continuity.
Follow a unified theme, like using a unique color palette and typography.
Follow the principle of "Content is king", always ensure that the design serves the content.
Use space, color, and fonts deliberately to guide user attention and interaction.
Ensure components behave in a predictable manner and in relation to their environment.

Accessibility Colors:
Make sure there is enough contrast between the background and foreground colors.
Use color to communicate information, but don't rely solely on it.
Avoid using colors that are known to cause issues for colorblind users (e.g., red/green).
When choosing a color palette, pick colors that have high contrast against each other.
Always remember, the beauty of a website lies in its usability and user experience. The use of beautiful colors and adherence to material design principles should enhance, not detract from, the overall user experience.
