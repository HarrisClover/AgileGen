#1. Description of the feature or narrative of the story

Narrative:
As a **computer user**,  
I want **a security software application that scans and removes viruses, malware, and other malicious threats from my computer system**,  
So that **I can keep my system secure by detecting and eliminating any potential security risks**.

#2. The background is executed once before each scenario

Background:
Given **the Virus Protector is installed and running on the system**

#3. Acceptance Criteria: (presented as Scenarios)

Scenario 1: Real-time Protection
Given **the Virus Protector is running**
And **the system is performing normal operations**
When **a malicious file is downloaded**
Then **the Virus Protector should detect the malicious file**
And **the Virus Protector should quarantine the malicious file**
And **notify the user of the threat**

Scenario 2: Scheduled Scanning
Given **the Virus Protector is running**
And **a scheduled scan is set for 2:00 AM daily**
When **the system clock reaches 2:00 AM**
Then **the Virus Protector should start a full system scan**
And **log the scan results**
And **notify the user if any threats are found**

Scenario 3: On-demand Scanning
Given **the Virus Protector is running**
And **the user initiates an on-demand scan**
When **the scan completes**

#4. Templates with placeholders require a table.

Scenario Outline: Virus Detection and Quarantine
Given **a file named <file_name> is downloaded**
And **the file is <file_type>**
When **the Virus Protector scans the file**
Then **the file should be <detection_result>**
And **the user should be notified with a message "<notification_message>"**

Examples:
| file_name     | file_type | detection_result | notification_message              |
| malicious.exe | malicious | quarantined      | "malicious.exe has been quarantined." |
| safe.doc      | safe      | safe             | "safe.doc is safe."               |

['Scenario 1: Real-time Protection\n\nIn this scenario, the Virus Protector software is actively running on the system, monitoring all activities and files. The system is performing its regular operations, such as opening files, running applications, and accessing the internet. During this time, a malicious file is downloaded onto the system. The Virus Protector detects the malicious file immediately upon download. It then quarantines the file to prevent it from executing or causing any harm to the system. Finally, the Virus Protector notifies the user about the detected threat, providing details about the malicious file and the actions taken.', 'Scenario 2: Scheduled Scanning\n\nIn this scenario, the Virus Protector software is running on the system, and a scheduled scan is set for 2:00 AM daily. When the system clock reaches 2:00 AM, the Virus Protector automatically starts a full system scan. It thoroughly scans all files and system activities for any potential threats. After completing the scan, the Virus Protector logs the scan results and notifies the user if any threats are found. This ensures that the system is regularly checked for security risks, even when the user is not actively using the computer.', 'Scenario 3: On-demand Scanning\n\nIn this scenario, the Virus Protector software is running on the system, and the user initiates an on-demand scan. The software begins scanning the system for any viruses, malware, or other malicious threats. Once the scan is complete, the Virus Protector displays the scan results to the user. It provides options to quarantine or delete any detected threats, allowing the user to take immediate action to secure the system.', 'Scenario 4: Updating Virus Definitions\n\nIn this scenario, the Virus Protector software is running on the system and is connected to the internet. When a new virus definition update becomes available, the Virus Protector automatically downloads and installs the update. This ensures that the software is equipped with the latest information to detect and eliminate new threats. After the update is installed, the Virus Protector notifies the user that the virus definitions have been updated, keeping the user informed about the enhanced security measures.', 'Scenario Outline: Virus Detection and Quarantine\n\nIn this scenario, a file named <file_name> is downloaded onto the system. The file can be either malicious or safe. When the Virus Protector scans the file, it determines whether the file is a threat or not. If the file is detected as malicious, it is quarantined to prevent any harm to the system. The user is then notified with a message indicating the status of the file, such as "<file_name> has been quarantined." If the file is safe, the user is informed that the file poses no threat. This scenario outlines the process of detecting and handling files based on their threat level.']
